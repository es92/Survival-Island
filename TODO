  dropping water on ocean results in automata looking at whole ocean

rendering
  simplify requests
    - don't load if load/unload later
  reorg world db by chunks, use fuzzy-hash-lock
  redraw by distance
  infinite distance
  look into instancing

automata
  water
    spread in multiple directions
    instead of propagating flow propagate force (default is down)
  plants

looks
  directional shading

world generation
  height map
    - diamond square, but noise as a function of scale (high noise if far apart, low noise if close together?)
